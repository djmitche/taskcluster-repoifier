1. You'll need lerna, git, yarn, and probably a couple more things to make this work
2. `make post` should get you 99% of the way to a monorepo based on the master branches of
   our repos (and some other branches that have various fixes in them)
3. After that you'll need to `yarn install`, `yarn lint --fix`, and finally manually fix the
   remaining lint issues
4. Some of our libraries/services only work with node 8. Use that for now
